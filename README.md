Implementation of the Micro toy language from "Crafting of a compiler with C". I appreciate the historical perspective of this 1991 book. Also, it's well-written, but you have numerous opportunities to do things smoother/cleaner (by passage of time, and probably as the authors state that C isn't their main language). You'll see it vastly differ from most details; while following the general outline closely.
